Explanation:
Graph Representation: The program uses an adjacency list representation of a graph.
Graph Functions:
createGraph(): Initializes a graph with a specified number of vertices.
addEdge(): Adds an edge between two vertices.
printGraph(): Prints the adjacency list representation.
searchEdge(): Checks if an edge exists.
updateEdge(): Modifies an existing edge.
deleteEdge(): Removes an edge from the graph.
Traversals:
BFS(): Implements Breadth-First Search.
DFS(): Implements Depth-First Search.
